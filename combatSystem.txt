Basic structure
-Combat is organized into a series of rounds each of which is made up of turns
-Each player rolls initiative based on their initiative pool. That value determines what actions a player can take on their turn

Initiative System:
-Turns occur in order from highest initiative value to lowest until there are no characters with more than 0 initiative left.
-Each character in combat starts each round with a certain initiative value, that value determines what actions they can take on their turn.
-Every action takes a certain amount of time and reduces initiative values appropriately.
-If a character wishes not to use all their initiative for this round they may store that value and add it to their roll next round.

Attacking:
-Attacks are resolved through a standard opposition roll between the weapon skill the attacker is using and the defensive skill the defender is using if they are using one.
-Armor reduces the amount of hits an attacker has by an amount determined by the armor value.

Damage:
-Wounds are based on degree of success of an attack and the base damage of the weapon.
